new versions of ETL_create_database wit reurn function at bottom of ETL function.  .png file shows movies table columns and data.  Previous .pgn had shown record cout 6051. Ratings.csv dropped (dummy db created to test code).  think this should be it.  thnks

# Movies_ETL
The products of ETL. Did not use sqlalchemy to load ratings table - imported the table structure from pandas, then imported the data directly into sql.  Showed the proper syntax in the create_database file, but did not use the method.  Can revise for next go-around.  however, table did load and display properly, per screenshot thanks
