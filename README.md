new versions of ETL_create_database with "reurn" function at bottom of ETL function.  .png file shows movies table columns and data.  Previous movies_query.png had shown record count 6051. Ratings.csv dropped (dummy db created to test code).  think this should be it.  thanks for the help.

# Movies_ETL
The products of ETL. Did not use sqlalchemy to load ratings table - imported the table structure from pandas, then imported the data directly into sql.  Showed the proper syntax in the create_database file, but did not use the method.  Can revise for next go-around.  however, table did load and display properly, per screenshot thanks
