# Movies_ETL
The products of ETL.  did not use sqlalchemy to load ratings table - imported the table structure from pandas, then imported the data directly into sql.  showed theproper syntax in the create_database file, but did not use the method.  can revise for next go-around.  however, table did load and display properly, per screenshot thanks
